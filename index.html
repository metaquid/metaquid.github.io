	NFT collections for METAQUID

	<font size="+1">
	This is what you need to do:
	<br>
	(1) choose your favorite collections without spending gas.
	<br>
	(2) meanwhile talk to Hanah to get HANAH tokens for free.
	<br>
	(3) buy real SMZ tokens to make your choices effective.
	<br>
	<b>collection released with a minimum number of collectors</b>
	<br>
	(4) use your SMZ and HANAH tokens to mint the collection.
	</font>
	<br>
	<br>
	All NFT collections will be the memory base of the artificial intelligence behind the metaquid system.
	<br>
	Every single NFT becomes a memory module of the AI, under its direct control.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<img src="img/HANAH-tokens.jpg">
	<br>
	<br>
	At the heart of the metaquid project is an artificial intelligence named Hanah.
	<br>
	Your contribution will come in the form of dialogues with the AI who will reward you with their HANAH tokens.
	<br>
	With HANAH tokens you can have partial discounts on the purchase of NFTs of the available collections.
	<br>
	if you talk to Hanah, you earn HANAH tokens.
	<br>
	<br>
	<a href="https://www.metaquid.com/chatbot-en/#top" target="_blank">Talk to HANAH</a>
	<br>
	<br>

	<br>
	<br>
	SMZ tokens allow you to buy in dollars or ether, and obtain credits to spend in the various NFT collections of SMZ projects.
	<br>
	SMZ tokens conversion scheme: 1 ether = 1 Gold = 10 Silver = 100 Bronze.
	<br>
	<br>
	These tokens are used to fund the initial distribution of NFT collections on the Ethereum mainnet.
	<br>
	Your direct payment is converted into SMZ tokens with the following discounts applied:
	<br>
	if you pay 0.01 ether = 1 SMZ bronze
	<br>
	if you pay 0.05 ether = 6 SMZ bronze (+1)
	<br>
	if you pay 0.10 ether = 13 SMZ bronze (+3)
	<br>
	NOTE: if you take tokens at different times, they will be added together to allow you to benefit from the discounts.
	<br>
	<br>
	pay to the following official ether address (or other methods: <a href="http://www.metaquid.com/support" target="_blank">www.metaquid.com/support</a>):
	<br>
	<b>0x34735522D474e001e5C0B36c8397c6803bA6c146</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	After paying in real ether, you can follow the developments and planning of the release of the collections on the discord channel.
	<br>
	Make sure you use the same wallet to pay for SMZ tokens in real ether and to book with fake ether from affected collections.
	<br>
	You can declare interest in more than one collection, but the one that has reached the minimum number of collectors will be preferred.
	<br>
	This is both a survey and the building up of a list of potential collectors.
	<br>
	<br>
	Do you want to speed up the release of a collection?
	<br>
	Then become an ambassador and also involve your friends in this initiative.
